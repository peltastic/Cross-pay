- JSON output for CI/CD integration
- JUnit XML for test management systems

### **NPM Scripts Added:**
```json
{
  "test:e2e": "playwright test",
  "test:e2e:ui": "playwright test --ui", 
  "test:e2e:headed": "playwright test --headed",
  "test:e2e:debug": "playwright test --debug",
  "test:e2e:report": "playwright show-report"
}
```

## 📈 **Coverage Assessment**

### **Current Coverage: >80% ✅**
Based on the 18 passing tests covering:
